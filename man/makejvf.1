Base line shift amount; the \fIinteger\fR represents a relative value,
using the character height as a base of 1000.
When a positive integer is specified, the characters are lowered.
When a negative integer is specified, the characters are raised.

.SH EXAMPLE
.TP 5
If you want to use min10 as Ryumin-Light-H, run
     makejvf min10.tfm rml
.TP 5
This generates min10.vf and rml.tfm. Put these files in an appropriate \
directory under TEXMF tree, and add the following line to psfonts.map.
     rml Ryumin-Light-H
